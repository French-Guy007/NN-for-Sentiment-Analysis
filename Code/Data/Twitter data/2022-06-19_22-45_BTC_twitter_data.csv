My guess is $10k will be tested before the bottom and I will be a buyer in that vicinity when I see Saylor forced liquidations.,0,0,Ask_Lou,1677,1538631927300759552

The problem with #Bitcoin is the same people who are buying are only trading it to make fiat currency.

They don't even believe it's a currency themselves &amp; it's proven it's not a store of value or hedge against inflation.

Just what is it exactly? A ponzi IMO",0,1,Starpunchshares,468,1538631882870603778
